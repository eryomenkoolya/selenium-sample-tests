# Sample UI tests (Java + Selenium + TestNG)

## Introduction
The tests are run against [Youtube website](https://www.youtube.com/).
Page Object is used as a design pattern. 
On top of that [PageFactory class](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/support/PageFactory.html)
is utilized to instantiate page objects.

## Executing the tests
Run `mvn clean test` in the command line from the root directory.
